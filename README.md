# Masterpiece

## Overview
Masterpiece is a data visualization and analysis tool that identifies patterns in data of a user's habits.

Inspired by the idea of a New Year's Resolution, Masterpiece considers data within the window of one year, and frames it within the cycle of a week, allowing users to understand their habits in relation to time at large.

## Philosophy

Masterpiece is also an experiment in recognizing the bias that is implicitly packaged together with self-reported data. This bias is created in a self-fulfilling prophecy that is inextricable from manual data entry: as time progresses and data is recorded, an individual becomes accustomed to, self-aware of, and eventually hyper-aware of the habit they are tracking. `And what is the relationship between my simultaneous creation of the tool, and the data that feeds it?`

The effect is almost Pavlovian as the feeling of performing a habit becomes a necessary precursor to the feeling of recording that habit as data. By extension, it is not unreasonable to think that the order of events might flip: `could an individual perform a habit for the pleasure of recording it?` `Might an individual avoid performing a habit in order to modify the data to their liking?` Perhaps it is inevitable that as we become closer with our data, we become farther from ourselves.

`Is data any more honest, then, when it is automated?` Automation can be inaccurate, `but is it any worse than the effects of our human biases?` One year into this experiment, I find myself stuck with (what I hope is a false) binary: imperfect (and human-designed) automation, or increasingly biased self-reported data. There may not be a Goldilocks option, and I'm beginning to think that it may be impossible to collect unbiased data about the self when the very act of recording data is a form of passive data analysis.
